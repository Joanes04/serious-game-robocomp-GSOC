This repository contains the work done during the GSOC 19. The following posts show detailed information about the process followed to achieve the final goal of develop a serious game in RoboComp. To achieve this, a web app has been developed. The web application is connected to RoboComp and is in charge of controlling the execution flow of the serious game. It monitors the development of the game. It also provides access to user management, sessions, participant data and results storage.
